## About
A simple and easy to use, yet powerful blog system for GetSimple CMS. With this plugin, you can create blog posts, sort posts by category, view posts in monthly archives, plus much more. The original concept for this plugin was by @mikehenken and was carried on through GetSimple Blog v3.x, but I've now decided to break away and start from scratch with an all-new code base. I welcome any and all suggestions for future improvements, and if you find any bugs, then please let me know.

The plugin will be a direct replacement for GetSimple Blog and will contain many new features that will be added natively, such as hooks and filters to allow extensibility by other plugins, native integration with some existing plugins, plus much more.

This plugin is currently under active development, but is a little while away from completion and ready for release yet. If youâ€™d like to track the development progress, please follow this GitHub project

A new team of translators will be needed for this plugin. If you speak any languages other than those that are already included, then please send me a PM so that I can add you to the project. A GitHub account is a must as the development process is maintained from there.

#### Features Include:
- Blog Categories
- Post Archives
- Recent Posts Lists
- Blog Post Tags
- Search Box
- Per-Category RSS Feeds
- External Comments Support
- Post Thumbnails
